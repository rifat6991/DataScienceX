Level-2 


    •	Numpy: Used for nearly all data crunching in Python.
    •	Pandas: A library for working with tables of data.
    •	Matplotlib: A library for plotting data.


NumPy: NumPy is a Python package to efficiently do data science. Learn to work with the NumPy array, a faster and more powerful alternative to the list, and take your first steps in data exploration.

    •	Numpy
    •	Numpy array
    •	Numpy side effects
    •	Subsetting Numpy array
    •	2D Numpy array
    •	Implementation of 2D Numpy array.
    •	Subsetting 2D Numpy array.
    •	Example of 2D Numpy Array.
    •	First Analysis.
    •	2D Arithmetic.
    •	Numpy: Statistics
    •	Average Vs. Median.
    •	Exploring Dataset.
    •	Implementation.



Pandas:  we will be using pandas for special cause called data framing. A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.

    •	Create a Pandas DataFrame
    •	Select an Index or Column From a DataFrame
    •	Add an Index, Row or Column to a DataFrame
    •	Delete Indices, Rows or Columns From a DataFrame
    •	Rename the Columns or Indices of a DataFrame
    •	Format the Data in Your DataFrame
    •	Write a DataFrame to a File

Matplotlib: Matplotlib will be using for the basics Python data visualization: the anatomy of a plot, pyplot and pylab, and much more.

    •	matplotlib, plotting
    •	sub-plot, axes, figure.
    •	plot creation.
    •	plotting routine.
    •	plot customization.
    •	saving, showing, clearing plot.
